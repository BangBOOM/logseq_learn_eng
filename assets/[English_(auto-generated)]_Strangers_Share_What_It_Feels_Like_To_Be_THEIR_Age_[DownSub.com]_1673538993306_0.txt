how does it feel to be 37. I got no

 idea what I'm doing with my life

how old are you

how old are you 87. holy I'm old I

forgot I feel lust I think I had no idea

my 50s would be this awesome today I'm

going to be asking strangers how old

they are and what it feels like to be

their age I'm just 23 years old yet

every day I wonder when I'm gonna start

feeling it age no matter how many

vegetables you eat how many times you

work out or how much you sleep it is

inevitable that your body and its

capabilities will change over time as I

live my day-to-day life I sometimes get

reminded by this from my past reminders

of things that happened six years ago

yet feel like they happened yesterday

and every time I'm reminded by them I

look at my face my body my mind

everything seems unfamiliar you know the

funny thing about life is that as we

grow we always look forward to being a

certain age but it seems at some point

we hit a certain plateau and then after

that we just wish that we were younger

feels like there's never a perfect time

to be alive I want to know if my best

years are behind me or of my best years

are still ahead of me this is not Girls

Gone Wild no no no how old are you

68. what does it feel like to be 68

years old

I learned through that in depth if you

want you feel like you played tackle

football the day before I just can't

remember why you feel so sore

and you're up and you're doing things

and you're just really sore you know

and then you go into the bathroom and

you go like this because all of a sudden

there's this old face in front of you

and you go holy

I'm old I forgot how old are you 29. can

you tell me what it feels like to be 29.

oh it feels great I feel like it's that

age where I still feel young but I can

do things of my own how old are you 43.

can you describe to me what it feels

like to be 43

oh

I'm like

teeter-tottering between young and old

right now and that feels

good but it also feels like a little

scary how old are you 23 21. can you

describe to me what it feels like to be

23.

um scary a little bit lost I feel like

we're all trying to discover what we

want who we are some stuff like that so

it's difficult to answer those questions

when you haven't had as much experience

how old are you my team can you describe

to me what it feels like to be 19.

I feel lost I think yeah pretty much

that too why do you feel lost so what do

you feel lost about

[Music]

as I was doing my research for this

video I came across a few studies and in

one study it concluded that the peak

life satisfaction that we will have in

our lives happens at the age of 23

meaning that the ages that I'm at right

now is apparently the age where I will

be the happiest to be alive now I find

that a bit ironic when a lot of the 23

year olds that I know who are working in

jobs that they don't like are telling me

that they are having panic attacks

because they're unsure of their Futures

and they don't like their careers and

that makes me wonder do we get a better

sense of clarity over who we are and

what we want out of life when we're

older how old are you

I'm 45. what does it feel like to be 45

feels good feels being mature and

knowing what you want how does it feel

different than being in your 20s and 30s

anyone always wants to be younger than

the age that they have right now when I

was 20 I wanted to be 30. 30 is the

perfect age when you reach 40

I think I have a better head on my

shoulders better understanding of life I

feel like there's so much uncertainty

when you're younger and it's like hard

to know what's going on in your future

and it's just more difficult to do

things I feel like late 20s and early

30s like the perfect age but that's not

the only study that I actually did

research on so let me give you a few

fast facts apparently your muscles are

at their strongest at the age of 25.

your physical strength is at its peak

and it will continue to stay that way

for the next 10 to 15 years your desire

to settle down is highest at the age of

26 because supposedly you've met enough

people to have some solid options out

there and perhaps more surprisingly is

when I kept reading on that original

study I spoke to you about Peak life

satisfaction apparently happens at 23

years old but apparently that same Peak

life satisfaction level also happens at

the age of 69. so you're telling me the

age of 69 it couldn't have been

a better age to pick is just as good as

the age of 23. if you don't mind me

asking do you have like at one age in

your life that was the best age no I

mean you know physically you start aging

when you're in your 30s early 40s so

you've been in Decline I've been in

Decline for almost 30 years in terms of

satisfaction of living what you do lose

in your physical abilities and as you

decline physically in age and wither I

think you get a little bit more mature

and you're able to handle life a little

better personally I would like to be 35

right now and how old are you now 44.

I'd say like in the 20s it's a very good

age because you don't have any

responsibilities I don't like to Look

Backwards all that much so I guess I'm

just looking forward to the future but I

guess the 20s if I could redo some of

the things that I did then I would do

that what would you redo I think I would

do more exploring I didn't do enough

exploring as a younger person why aren't

you going now

I have a seven-year-old child our

primary focus is raising him how old are

you I'm 66. can you describe to me what

it feels like to be 66. depend on the

person I feel like I'm 30. and I'm full

of energy yeah you want to race yeah go

ahead okay you count down for us okay

[Music]

no idea what I'm doing with my

life

preach did you ever feel like you did no

no not yet apparently you get the hang

of it later but I don't know when later

it's supposed to be 50 50. 50. to me

aging just means you get old you get

wrinkly it's hard to get it up and I

mean life just doesn't seem to be as

good because you just can't move you

can't see you can't hear this is the

definition of Aging aging refers to the

physiological changes that we experience

during our lifespan physiological the

definition of Aging only speaks about

what happens physically that means that

as your body might get older it doesn't

necessarily mean that your mind does too

how old are you guys I'm 37 67. what

does it feel like to be 67

it feels like 20 except everything hurts

I don't feel any different than I felt

in my 20s inside how old are you I'm 31.

can you describe what it feels like to

be 31. I was just at a museum and they

have lower prices for people between 20

and 30 and so I just officially learned

that I'm old

how old are you

seriously I am 57. what does it feel

like you can describe it to me to be 57.

it's incredibly liberating I'll be

honest you no longer care about what

others think as much as you did at a

younger age usually by this time in your

life you're more established as well so

there's not that weight on you but no I

had no idea my 50s would be this awesome

what were you expecting

um more of what the 40s were 30s and 40s

are hard work and raising children and

working and moving ahead in your career

and 55 is not that you know someone

younger what would you tell them to look

forward to or what should they tell them

to keep in mind that

the days are long but the years are

short

how old are you 87 87 can you describe

to me what it feels like to be 87. your

feet get sore

there's a few keep you from walking a

long distance how old do you feel

mentally I'd say about 68 I skate three

times a week I have waste in my house

like I train 20 pounds 25 pound weights

and you have a license for these guns

right do you have a license for these

guns do you have a favorite age like if

you could go back in time and live one

year again is there one age that you'd

go back to well yeah 26 27 28 I was

playing professional hockey and I wasn't

married I was free as the wind I played

one game in the NHL of training camp

cool I was 17 years old what year was

that 1953. now I've been talking to a

bunch of strangers on the street these

are all impersonal conversations with

people that I've never met before that

were just really nice to actually share

a little bit about their lives with me

but I wanted to have a more meaningful

in-depth conversation with someone older

than me so naturally I go to the words

the most experienced older person that I

know my dad if you could go back to any

age

that you've lived so far is there one in

particular that you would relive you

know looking back I like to look at uh

living in periods of of 10-year

increments each increment brought a

different Vision to life would I like to

relive one no because I think it's just

a compilation of each level or period

that really brings you to the person you

are today how old are you I'm 60 years

old so are your best years behind you or

are your best years ahead of you well

I'm just 23 and if we're comparing

myself in terms of age then to the

majority of people it seems as if I

haven't truly lived yet but if these

conversations have made me realize one

thing it's that I am hopeful I'm hopeful

of the fact that as we get older

life doesn't necessarily get shittier

I'm hopeful to know that when I turn 30

it's not going to feel as devastating as

everyone's making it out to be and that

my best years are definitely still ahead

of me but if I get sum all of that up

into just one realization it would be

time and time again that age and life is

just a mindset how you decide to lead

your life purely depends on how you

think if you have a good mindset and you

believe that you're young then you will

always be young even if you're 69 73 or

87 years old

what's your name my name is William do

you still live at home I do live at home

yep weird question but does your mom

still do your laundry look my mom's a

nice woman but I do travel a lot and

when I do travel I tend to do my own

luck have you ever heard of true Earth

I've never heard true Earth so true

Earth is this Canadian company they make

eco-friendly products that basically

help you reduce the amount of plastic

that you use in your household and

actually one of their signature products

are these eco-friendly laundry strips

that you can basically carry around

mom does your laundry I will tell you
