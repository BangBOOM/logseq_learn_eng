		- rejection hurts.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 9}}
			- It's [[incredibly]] painful to feel like you are not wanted
		- {{youtube-timestamp 14}}

		- {{youtube-timestamp 37}}
			- So Why dose rejection trigger such a strong response. And Is there anyway to cope with unique kind of pain.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 45}}
			- Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we [[perceive]] that others don't value having social connections with us.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 54}}
			- This could occur when we were abandoned by our romantic partner, excluded from a group
		- {{youtube-timestamp 59}}
			- Or [[outright]] [[discriminate]]d against.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 62}}
			- But it worth noting that these interpersonal rejection has a social element that [[distinguish]]es them from not getting a job.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 71}}
			- we perceive that rejecting party undervalues our relationship, and while the pain of rejection often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers can hurt our feeling.
