- Once upon a time, there was a young judge who was known for her **apt** decisions. One day, she had to make a ruling on a case that involved an **abstraction** of art. The evidence presented in court was so confusing that it would **astound** anyone. However, the judge remained calm and relied on her strong **constitution** to make the right decision. She carefully considered each piece of evidence and used her power to **counter** any false claims. In the end, she made a fair ruling and everyone was happy. After the trial, she went home and enjoyed a refreshing salad with slices of **cucumber**.
