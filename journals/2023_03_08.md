	- Once upon a time, there was a young judge who was known for her **==apt==** decisions. One day, she had to make a ruling on a case that involved an **==abstraction==** of art. The evidence presented in court was so confusing that it would **==astound==** anyone. However, the judge remained calm and relied on her strong **==constitution==** to make the right decision. She carefully considered each piece of evidence and used her power to **==counter==** any false claims. In the end, she made a fair ruling and everyone was happy. After the trial, she went home and enjoyed a refreshing salad with slices of **==cucumber==**.
	  words:: [[apt]], [[astound]], [[constitution]], [[counter]], [[cucumber]]
	- The next day, the young judge had to preside over another case. This time it was about a man who had been accused of trying to **==decapitate==** a statue in the town square. The evidence against him was strong and included a bottle of **==detergent==** that he had used to try and clean up the mess. However, as the ==trial== progressed, new evidence came to light that caused the judge’s certainty to **==diminish==**. There were several **==variations==** in witness testimonies and some even began to **==disparage==** each other. The judge carefully considered all the evidence and eventually ruled that the man was not guilty. Afterward, she went home feeling exhausted and made herself a cup of tea with honey so thick and **==viscous==** it took forever to stir.
	  words:: [[decapitate]], [[detergent]], [[diminish]], [[disparage]], [[variation]], [[viscous]]

	- Lily was a ==patriotic== girl who loved her country. She lived near a ==gorgeous== ==harbour== where she liked to watch the boats and the sunset. One day, she saw a ==lime==-green balloon floating in the air. She wanted to catch it, so she ran after it. But as she reached for it, the wind blew it away. She followed it until she came to a bridge that was under construction. The balloon got stuck under the bridge, but Lily couldn't reach it. She had an idea: she would ==invert== her body and hang upside down from the railing. She ==grabbed== the railing and ==swung== her legs over it. She felt a rush of blood to her head as she saw the balloon closer than ever. She ==stretched== her arm and touched it with her fingers. She smiled with joy and ==maturity== as she finally caught the balloon.
	  words:: [[gorgeous]], [[harbour]], [[invert]], [[lime]], [[maturity]], [[patriotic]]
	- Lily was so happy with her balloon that she didn't notice a man watching her from the other side of the bridge. He was a thief who wanted to steal her balloon. He thought it was a lucky charm that would bring him fortune. He was very ==superstitious== and believed in magic and fate. He waited until Lily crossed the bridge and then followed her quietly. He saw her enter a ==spacious== park where she sat on a bench and admired her balloon. He thought this was his chance to grab it and run away. He approached her from behind and reached for the balloon's string. But Lily sensed his ==presence== and turned around quickly. She saw his face and screamed. She held the balloon tightly and kicked him in the ==shin==. He groaned in pain and fell to the ground. He looked at his leg and saw a big ==bruise== forming on it. He realized he had made a mistake and ran away as fast as he could. Lily was brave and smart to defend herself from the thief. She knew he had no ==plausible== reason to take her balloon.
	  words:: [[plausible]], [[slim]], [[spacious]], [[superstitious]], [[vulnerable]], [[bruise]].
