- Once upon a time, there was an **apt** young man who had an **astounding** ability to memorize the **constitution**. He could recite it word for word without missing a beat. One day, he decided to put his skills to the test and entered a competition. The challenge was to recite the constitution while standing on one foot and balancing a **cucumber** on his head.
