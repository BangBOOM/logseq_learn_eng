	- Once upon a time, there was a young judge who was known for her **==apt==** decisions. One day, she had to make a ruling on a case that involved an **==abstraction==** of art. The evidence presented in court was so confusing that it would **==astound==** anyone. However, the judge remained calm and relied on her strong **==constitution==** to make the right decision. She carefully considered each piece of evidence and used her power to **==counter==** any false claims. In the end, she made a fair ruling and everyone was happy. After the trial, she went home and enjoyed a refreshing salad with slices of **==cucumber==**.

	- The next day, the young judge had to preside over another case. This time it was about a man who had been accused of trying to **decapitate** a statue in the town square. The evidence against him was strong and included a bottle of **detergent** that he had used to try and clean up the mess. However, as the trial progressed, new evidence came to light that caused the judge’s certainty to **diminish**. There were several **variations** in witness testimonies and some even began to **disparage** each other. The judge carefully considered all the evidence and eventually ruled that the man was not guilty. Afterward, she went home feeling exhausted and made herself a cup of tea with honey so thick and **viscous** it took forever to stir.
