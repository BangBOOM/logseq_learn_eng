	- **The Arboreal Adventure**
	- Anna loved to climb trees. She was an ==arboreal== girl who enjoyed being close to nature. She liked to see the flowers ==bloom== in spring and smell their sweet fragrance. She also liked to watch the birds and squirrels that lived in the branches.
	- One day, she decided to climb a very tall tree near the equator. It was a tropical tree with many fruits and flowers. Anna was curious about what she would find at the top. She climbed higher and higher, ignoring her motherâ€™s calls to come down.
	- She reached the top and saw a beautiful view of the jungle. She felt like she was on top of the world. She also saw a monkey sitting on a nearby branch. The monkey looked friendly and offered her a banana. Anna smiled and took it.
