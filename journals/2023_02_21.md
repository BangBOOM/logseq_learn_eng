	- A group of US Navy ==SEALs== was training in Arizona when they encountered a ==prominent== threat: coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores from the soil. The ==infection== caused fever, cough, chest pain, and ==spasmodic== muscle aches in 10 of the 22 men. They were ==evacuated== to a ==military== hospital for treatment and diagnosis. The doctors performed a ==comprehensive== examination and confirmed the infection by serologic testing. They ==prescribed== antifungal drugs and advised rest and hydration. The SEALs recovered after several weeks and returned to their ==headquarters==. They learned that coccidioidomycosis is ==endemic== in the southwestern United States and can be prevented by wearing masks and avoiding dust exposure. They also received a ==stimulus== package from their commander, which included some healthy ==snacks== such as ==almond bars== and nuts. The commander praised them for their bravery and resilience, and asked them to write a report that would ==depict== their experience and lessons learned.
