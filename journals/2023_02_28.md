	- Anna wanted to buy a new car, but she had a problem. She liked the speed and power of a sports car, but she also cared about the environment and ==fuel== efficiency. She decided to ==compromise== and look for a ==hybrid== car that had both features.
	- A young scientist named Lisa wanted to create a ==hybrid== animal that could fly and swim. She did not care about the risks or the ==ethics== of her experiment. She ==disregarded== the warnings of her colleagues and the laws of nature. She was ==dauntless== in her ==pursuit== of her dream.
	  One day, she finally succeeded in combining the genes of a bird and a fish. She was overjoyed to see her creation come to life in a glass tank. It had colorful feathers and scales, wings and fins. It looked ==hypnotic== as it moved gracefully in the water and air.
	  However, Lisa soon realized that her hybrid animal was unhappy and lonely. It had no friends or family of its own kind. It also had health problems due to its unnatural origin. Lisa felt sorry for what she had done. She decided to ==compromise== with her colleagues and find a way to help her hybrid animal live a better life.
