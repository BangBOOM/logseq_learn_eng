	- A young scientist named Lisa wanted to create a ==hybrid== animal that could fly and swim. She did not care about the risks or the ==ethics== of her experiment. She ==disregarded== the warnings of her colleagues and the laws of nature. She was ==dauntless== in her ==pursuit== of her dream.
	  One day, she finally succeeded in combining the genes of a bird and a fish. She was overjoyed to see her creation come to life in a glass tank. It had colorful feathers and scales, wings and fins. It looked ==hypnotic== as it moved gracefully in the water and air.
