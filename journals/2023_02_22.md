	- Anna was writing a **==biography==** of her grandfather, who was a **==federal==** judge. She had to finish a **==draft==** of the first chapter before her ==**doctoral**== ==defense==. She had been working on it for months, but she still felt unsatisfied with her writing. She decided to take a break and go for a walk.
	- As she walked around the park, she saw a group of kids playing soccer. She decided to join them for fun. She was having a great time until she felt a sharp pain in her **==elbow==**. She had collided with another player and injured herself.
	- She went to the hospital and found out that she had ==fractured== her ==elbow==. She had to wear a cast for six weeks. She felt ==frustrated== and angry. How could she finish her biography now?
	- She decided to not **==dwell==** on her bad luck and focus on her recovery. She asked her friends and family for help with typing and editing her draft.
	- She worked hard despite her pain and **==exhaustion==**. She managed to finish her draft on time and submit it to her supervisor.
	- Her supervisor was impressed by her work and praised her for overcoming such a challenge.
	- Anna felt proud and relieved. Her hard work had paid off.
	- Her biography project would soon **==culminate==** in a successful doctoral defense.
