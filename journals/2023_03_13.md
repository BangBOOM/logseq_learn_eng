	  Once upon a time, there was a greedy ==baron== (a nobleman who owned a lot of land and wealth) who loved to eat. He had a huge ==appetite== (a desire for food) and he would never share his food with anyone. One day, he heard that a farmer had grown a giant ==pumpkin== in his field. The baron wanted to have the pumpkin for himself, so he ordered his men to take it away from the farmer. 
	  
	  The farmer was very angry and he decided to get his pumpkin back. He waited until nightfall and then sneaked into the baronâ€™s castle. He found the pumpkin in the kitchen and tried to roll it out of the door. But as he was doing so, he bumped into a guard. The guard shouted and alerted the other guards. The farmer ran away, leaving the pumpkin behind. 
	  
	  The guards chased after the farmer, but they did not see the pumpkin in the dark. They ran into it and caused a big ==collision== (a crash or impact). The pumpkin broke into pieces and ==splashed== all over the floor. The baron heard the noise and came downstairs. He saw his precious pumpkin ruined and he was ==furious==. He yelled at the guards and blamed them for destroying his dinner. 
	  
	  The next day, the baron felt sick. He had eaten too much food and his stomach was hurting. He asked his doctor for some medicine to ==alleviate== (to make less severe or painful) his pain. The doctor gave him a ==potion== that was supposed to help him digest better. But the potion was actually made from ==rotten== eggs and vinegar. The doctor wanted to teach the baron a lesson for being so selfish and cruel. 
	  
	  The baron drank the potion and immediately felt worse. He felt a burning sensation in his throat and chest. The potion was causing his teeth to decay (to rot or break down) and his tongue to dissolve (to melt or disappear). He realized too late that he had been poisoned by his own doctor. He regretted being so greedy and wished he had shared his food with others. But it was too late for him to change. He died in agony and misery.
