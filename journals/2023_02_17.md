	- The Impetus
	  - Anna was an attentive student who loved to learn new things. She had a passion for traveling and exploring different cultures. She dreamed of visiting many countries and seeing their wonders.
	  - One day, she received an email from her school. It was an invitation to join a trip to China, where they would visit some of the most industrialized cities and learn about their history and development. Anna was thrilled and immediately signed up for the trip.
	  - She started to prepare her itinerary and pack her bags. She also bought a guidebook and a phrasebook to help her communicate with the locals. She was so excited that she could barely conceal her joy.
	  - However, not everyone shared her enthusiasm. Her classmates were disdainful of her interest in China. They thought it was a boring and polluted place with nothing to see or do. They also disliked the Chinese people and their customs. They often made fun of Anna and tried to discourage her from going.
	  - Anna felt hurt by their disharmony and negativity. She wondered why they were so hostile and closed-minded. She decided not to let them ruin her trip and ignored their comments.
	  
	  She found an impetus in her curiosity and passion for learning. She knew that China had much more to offer than what they thought. She looked forward to discovering its beauty and diversity for herself.
