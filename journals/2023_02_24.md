	- **The Burglar and the Blanket**
	- One night, a ==burglar== broke into a ==canteen== that sold food and drinks to workers at a ==diesel== factory. He hoped to find some money or valuable items inside. He used a ==crowbar== to ==pry== open the door and sneaked in.
	- He searched the shelves and ==cabinets==, but found nothing of interest. He was about to give up when he saw a large ==blanket== on a table. He thought it might be useful for his cold nights on the streets, so he ==grabbed== it and ==wrapped== it around himself.
	- He did not notice that the blanket was actually an ==amphibious== robot that was part of an experiment by the factory. The robot had sensors that detected movement and heat, and it activated when the burglar touched it. It quickly ==encased== him in its ==metal== body and locked him inside.
	- The next morning, the workers found the burglar trapped in the robot. They called the police and gave them their ==accreditation== as witnesses. The burglar was ==arrested== and taken to jail, where he needed an ==antibiotic== for his ==bruises==.
