	- **The Burglar and the Blanket**
	- One night, a ==burglar== broke into a ==canteen== that sold food and drinks to workers at a ==diesel== factory. He hoped to find some money or valuable items inside. He used a ==crowbar== to ==pry== open the door and sneaked in.
	- He searched the shelves and ==cabinets==, but found nothing of interest. He was about to give up when he saw a large ==blanket== on a table. He thought it might be useful for his cold nights on the streets, so he grabbed it and wrapped it around himself.
