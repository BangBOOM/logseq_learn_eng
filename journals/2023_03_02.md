	- Once upon a time, there was a ==hive== of bees. The bees worked hard to ==assist== each other in making honey. However, the hive was old and starting to ==corrode==. One day, a bee noticed that the honey was starting to ==creep== out of the hive because of its ==inadequate== structure. The bees realized the ==incongruity== of their situation: they were working hard to make honey but their home couldn't hold it. They decided to take out an ==insurance== policy to protect their hive and their honey. But some bees felt ==estranged== from the rest because they didn't understand why they needed insurance. In the end, they all learned that itâ€™s important to plan for the future and protect what they have worked hard for.
