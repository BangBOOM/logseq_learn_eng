	- One cold winter day, a little girl named Anna went to the park with her dog. She wanted to play in the snow and make a snowman. As she was walking, she saw a big pile of snow that looked very **==dense==**. (Dense means something that has a lot of mass in a small space.) She decided to dig into the snow and see what was inside. To her surprise, she found four little kittens **==huddled==** together under the snow. (Huddled means to gather close together for warmth or protection.) They were shivering and scared. Anna felt sorry for them and decided to take them home. She **==embraced==** them gently and put them in her coat. (Embraced means to hug or hold someone or something closely.) On her way home, she **==encountered==** an old lady who was looking for her lost cats. (Encountered means to meet or come across someone or something unexpectedly.) The lady was very happy to see that Anna had found her kittens. She thanked Anna and gave her a reward. Anna was glad that she could help the lady and the kittens. She went home with her dog and enjoyed some hot chocolate.

	- The next day, Anna wanted to go back to the park and see if she could find more kittens. She asked her mom if she could go, but her mom had an **objection**. (Objection means a reason or argument against something.) She said that it was too cold and dangerous to go out alone. She told Anna to stay home and play with her dog. Anna was disappointed, but she understood her mom’s concern. She decided to play with her dog in the backyard instead. Her dog was her best **companion**. (Companion means a friend or partner who accompanies someone.) They had a lot of fun chasing each other and making snow angels.
	- Meanwhile, the old lady who owned the kittens went to the pet store to buy some food and toys for them. The pet store was owned by a friendly **retailer**. (Retailer means a person or business that sells goods to customers.) He knew the old lady well and always gave her good deals. He was also very fond of animals and liked to help them.
