	- Lila was a spy who used ==camouflage== to blend in with her surroundings. She had a mission to ==inspect== a secret lab where a dangerous weapon was being developed. She ==disguised== herself as a scientist and entered the lab with a ==tome== that contained her spy gadgets.
	  
	  She ==complimented== one of the guards on his hair and offered him some ==conditioner== that had a sleeping agent in it. He accepted it and fell asleep after using it. Lila then sneaked into the weapon room and saw a huge machine that looked like a fence. It was supposed to fire ==gelatine== bullets that could trap enemies in sticky blobs.
	  
	  Lila decided to sabotage the machine by using her ==instrumental== skills. She opened the tome and took out a screwdriver and some wires. She tampered with the machine's circuitry and made it malfunction. Then she escaped from the lab before anyone noticed.
