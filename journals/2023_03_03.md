	- Once upon a time, there was a **==decrepit==** man who lived in a small village. He had a **==cage==** where he kept his pet bird. One day, the bird flew away and the old man was very sad. He searched everywhere for his bird but could not find it. Then he remembered that the bird loved to sit on a **==bent==** tree branch near the river. So he followed the **==track==** to the river and found his bird sitting on the bent branch. The old man was overjoyed and brought his bird back home.
