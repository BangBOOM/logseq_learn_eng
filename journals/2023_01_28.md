			- I was born 12:05 AM on November 6th, 5 minutes short of being [[eligible]] to vote in the [[election]] tomorrow.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 30}}
		  collapsed:: true
			- It's [[arbitrary]] and unfair. The voting age should be lowered to 16!.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 38}}
		  collapsed:: true
			- I firmly disagree! No way 16-year-olds are [[mature]] enough to  make decisions with national [[consequence]]s.

			- Exactly, If 16-year-olds aren't mature enough to vote, then by that same logic they shouldn't be allowed to drive.

		- {{youtube-timestamp 74}}
			- some countries have lowered the voting age to 16
		- {{youtube-timestamp 77}}
			- And cultural coming-of-age ceremonies ([[ceremony]]) are often celebrated at different ages.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 82}}
			- As there seems to be no [[consensus]] on exactly when we reach maturity, perhaps science can give us a clear answer.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 90}}
			- One way neural scientists have looked to define adulthood is by when the brain is fully grown, brain development involves two trajectories ([[trajectory]]). First there's a reduction in gray matter. Gray matter consists of cells and connections that [[facilitate]] communication at short ranges, creating dense, information-processing hubs.
		- {{youtube-timestamp 111}}
			- While a reduction may seem like a bad thing, what's happening is a [[selective]] [[pruning]].

				- Our conception of time depends on the way we measure it
				- A According to archaeological evidence, at least 5,000 years ago, and long before the advent of the Roman Empire, the Babylonians began to measure time, introducing calendars to co-ordinate communal activities, to plan the shipment of goods and, in particular, to regulate planting and harvesting. They based their calendars on three natural cycles: the solar day, marked by the successive periods of light and darkness as the earth rotates on its axis; the lunar month, following the phases of the moon as it orbits the earth; and the solar year, defined by the changing seasons that accompany our planet's revolution around the sun.
				- B Before the invention of artificial light, the moon had greater social impact. And, for those living near the equator in particular, its waxing and waning was more conspicuous than the passing of the seasons. Hence, the calendars that were developed at the lower latitudes were influenced more by the lunar cycle than by the solar year. In more northern climes, however, where seasonal agriculture was practised, the solar year became more crucial. As the Roman Empire expanded northward, it organised its activity chart for the most part around the solar vear.
				- C Centuries before the Roman Empire, the Egyptians had formulated a municipal calendar having 12 months of 30 days, with five days added to approximate the solar year. Each period of ten days was marked by the appearance of special groups of stars called decans. At the rise of the star Sirius just before sunrise, which occurred around the all-important annual flooding of the Nile, 12 decans could be seen spanning the heavens. The cosmic significance the Egyptians placed in the 12 decans led them to develop a system in which each interval of darkness (and later, each interval of daylight) was divided into a dozen equal parts. These periods became known as temporal hours because their duration varied according to the changing length of days and nights with the passing of the seasons. Summer hours were long, winter ones short; only at the spring and autumn equinoxes
