	- **An Epidemic**
	- Once upon a time, there was a small town where everyone lived in peace and harmony. However, one day, an ==epidemic== broke out and caused ==chaos==. People started to ==discriminate against== each other and the ==casualty== rate began to ==escalate==. The town was in a ==cascade== of fear and mistrust.
	  
	  The town's only hope was the ==assistant==, who had the ability to ==absorb== information and knowledge. The assistant suggested that they all ==coexist== and work together to overcome the epidemic. The town ==residents==, with some ==hesitation==, took the assistant's advice and started to ==credit each other== for their strengths. Slowly but surely, the town returned to its peaceful state and the epidemic was ==contained==. The town learned a valuable lesson about the importance of unity and ==cooperation==.

	- **A gregarious girl**
	- She was a ==gregarious== girl who loved to dance. She had an ==inherent== talent for ==neoclassical== ballet and dreamed of performing on stage. But her parents were poor and could not afford to send her to a proper school. They lived in a small apartment with no ==aeration== and ==fluctuating== electricity.
	  
	  One day, she saw an advertisement for a scholarship ==audition== at a prestigious academy. She decided to try her luck and prepared for weeks. She borrowed a dress from her friend and took the bus to the city. She arrived at the venue and was amazed by the grandeur of the building. She felt nervous but excited. She registered her name and waited for her turn.
	  
	  But as she was about to enter the hall, she was ==assaulted== by a group of masked men who grabbed her bag and ran away. She screamed and chased them, but they were too fast. She lost everything: her dress, her shoes, her ID card, her money. She had no way of proving who she was or why she was there. She collapsed on the sidewalk and cried bitterly. 
	  
	  It was a ==hypothetical== scenario that she had imagined many times before. But it never happened. She ==persisted== in pursuing her passion and eventually became a famous dancer.
