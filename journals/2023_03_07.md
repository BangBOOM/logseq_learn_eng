	- Once upon a time, there was a **==firm==** tree standing tall in the forest. Its branches were **==bare==**, with no leaves to be seen. One day, a group of animals gathered around the tree to discuss a problem. The problem was quite **==complicated==**, and they spent hours in **==elaboration==**. The wise old owl spoke with great **==esteem==**, warning them of the potential **==hazards==** that lay ahead. In the end, they came up with a solution and worked together to solve the problem.
	- The animals soon realized that their solution was not perfect. Some felt **==inferior==** and were afraid to speak up. But the wise old owl encouraged them to **==inform==** the others of their concerns. They worked together to come up with a new plan, one that would benefit everyone. As they looked around at their beautiful forest, with its **==picturesque==** scenery, they knew they had to protect it from the dangers of **==poverty==** and **==pretension==**.
