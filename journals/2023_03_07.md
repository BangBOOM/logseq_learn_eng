	- Once upon a time, there was a **==firm==** tree standing tall in the forest. Its branches were **==bare==**, with no leaves to be seen. One day, a group of animals gathered around the tree to discuss a problem. The problem was quite **==complicated==**, and they spent hours in **==elaboration==**. The wise old owl spoke with great **==esteem==**, warning them of the potential **==hazards==** that lay ahead. In the end, they came up with a solution and worked together to solve the problem.
