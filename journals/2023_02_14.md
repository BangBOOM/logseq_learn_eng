	- Dr. Lee had a ==doctorate== in engineering, but he worked as a ==mechanic== at a secret ==facility==.

He looked back and saw that one of the wings had ==detached== from the car. He quickly ==manoeuvred== the car to a safe landing spot, and got out to ==inspect== the damage. He saw that the wing was lying on a ==mattress== that someone had dumped on the side of the road. He was ==relieved== that the wing was not broken, but he wondered how he would reattach it to the car. He had no tools or spare parts with him.
	- The opulent mansion was reduced to debris after the explosion. The police suspected a delinquent gang had planted a bomb in the basement, using a propellant to trigger the blast. The gang had been targeting wealthy homeowners, extorting them for revenue and threatening them with violence.
	  One of the victims was a young woman named Lisa, who had inherited the mansion from her late uncle. She had been seduced by a charming man named Mark, who turned out to be the leader of the gang. He had pretended to be a pedestrian who needed help, and had gained her trust and access to her home.
	  Lisa was lucky to survive the explosion, as she had left the mansion earlier to buy some groceries. She realized that Mark was a predator who had used her, and she vowed to seek justice. She contacted the police and offered to help them catch the gang.
