- [[sentence to remember words]]
	- Tom had an **==episodic==** memory problem. He could not remember what he did yesterday or last week. He only remembered some important events in his life, like his birthday or graduation. He tried to **==conserve==** his memories by writing them down in a diary every day. One day, he met a **==notable==** person: the president of his country. He was so excited that he wanted to take a photo with him. But he **==disobeyed==** the security guard who told him to stay away. He ran towards the president and tried to hug him. The guard tackled him and took him away. Tom had to **==forfeit==** his chance to meet the president and his diary was ==confiscated==.

	- Tom was arrested for ==fraud==. He had lied about his ==identity== and his job. He was not a journalist, but a spy. He wanted to get close to the president and steal some secrets.

He moved to a small town and rented a room in an old house. The ==interior== of the house was dark and dusty. There were many paintings of saints and angels on the walls. The owner of the house was a ==religious== woman who liked to pray every day. She also had a ==cart== full of books that she sold on the street. She offered Tom some books to read, but he refused. He did not care about religion or anything else.
