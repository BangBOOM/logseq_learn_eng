	- Tom had an **==episodic==** memory problem. He could not remember what he did yesterday or last week. He only remembered some important events in his life, like his birthday or graduation. He tried to **==conserve==** his memories by writing them down in a diary every day. One day, he met a **==notable==** person: the president of his country. He was so excited that he wanted to take a photo with him. But he **==disobeyed==** the security guard who told him to stay away. He ran towards the president and tried to hug him. The guard tackled him and took him away. Tom had to **==forfeit==** his chance to meet the president and his diary was ==confiscated==.
