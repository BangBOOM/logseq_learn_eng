	- In a land far away, there was a **==slave==** who had been taken from his home and forced to work in the fields. He struggled to **==assimilate==** into his new life and often felt out of place. One day, he overheard some **==anecdotal==** stories about a wise man who gave great **==counsel==**. The slave decided to seek out this wise man for advice. The wise man listened to the slave’s troubles and advised him to **==conform==** to the ways of his new land while still holding onto his own beliefs and values. He also taught the slave about the importance of hard work and how it could turn into a valuable **==commodity==**. The slave took this advice to heart and worked hard in the fields despite the hot sun beating down on him at 40 degrees **==centigrade==**. Over time, he became respected in his community and even helped prevent **==delinquency==** among the youth.
