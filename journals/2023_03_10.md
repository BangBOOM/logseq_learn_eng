	- Lena was an **==administrative==** assistant at a small library. She loved her job and enjoyed helping the **==community==** with their reading needs. She also liked to check the **==circulation==** numbers of the books and see which ones were popular. One day, she received a letter from the city ==council==. It said that the library was going to be closed due to ==budget== cuts. Lena was shocked and sad. She felt that this was very **==dispiriting==** for her and the library users. She decided to do something about it. She started a ==petition== to save the library and asked her friends and neighbors to sign it. She also contacted some local media outlets and told them about the situation. Her efforts paid off. The petition gathered thousands of signatures and the media coverage attracted attention from people far **==afield==**. The city council reconsidered their decision and agreed to keep the library open. Lena was overjoyed and thanked everyone who supported her cause. She continued to work at the library with a renewed passion.

	- Anna loved to **==excavate==** (dig up) fossils in her backyard. She felt an **==exhilaration==** (a feeling of excitement and happiness) every time she found a new one. She wanted to share her passion with her best friend Leo, who was very **==indolent==** (lazy) and preferred to play video games all day. One day, she convinced him to join her in her fossil hunt. She gave him a shovel and a bucket and told him to start digging. Leo was ==reluctant== at first, but soon he discovered a large bone that looked like a dinosaur's. He was amazed and curious. He asked Anna what it was and how old it was. Anna said it was probably millions of years old and that they had to **==fertilise==** (make the soil more fertile) the ground around it to preserve it. She also said that they could **==intimate==** (suggest or hint) their discovery to their teacher and maybe get extra credit for their science project. Leo agreed and smiled. He realised that excavating fossils was more fun than he thought.

	- The next day, Anna and Leo brought their fossil to school and showed it to their science teacher, Mr. Jones. He was very impressed and said that they had found a rare ==specimen== of a triceratops. He said that he would contact a **==reputable==** (trustworthy and respected) museum to examine it further. He also praised them for their hard work and curiosity. Anna and Leo were very happy and proud. They thanked Mr. Jones and went to their class.  However, not everyone was happy for them. Billy, the class bully, was jealous and angry. He wanted to **==taunt==** (mock or insult) them and make them feel bad. He called them names like "nerds" and "geeks". He also said that they were Mr. Jones' **underlings** (subordinates or followers) and that they had no life outside school. He said that they were **workaholics** (people who work too much and neglect other aspects of life) who only cared about fossils and grades. He tried to make them feel ashamed of their passion.
