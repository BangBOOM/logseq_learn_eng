	- Lena was an **==administrative==** assistant at a small library. She loved her job and enjoyed helping the **==community==** with their reading needs. She also liked to check the **==circulation==** numbers of the books and see which ones were popular. One day, she received a letter from the city ==council==. It said that the library was going to be closed due to ==budget== cuts. Lena was shocked and sad. She felt that this was very **==dispiriting==** for her and the library users. She decided to do something about it. She started a ==petition== to save the library and asked her friends and neighbors to sign it. She also contacted some local media outlets and told them about the situation. Her efforts paid off. The petition gathered thousands of signatures and the media coverage attracted attention from people far **afield**. The city council reconsidered their decision and agreed to keep the library open. Lena was overjoyed and thanked everyone who supported her cause. She continued to work at the library with a renewed passion.
