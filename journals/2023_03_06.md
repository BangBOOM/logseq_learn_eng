	- Once upon a time, there was a **==solicitor==** who lived in a small village. One day, a **==controversy==** arose in the village over the use of the village pond. Some villagers wanted to use it for fishing while others wanted to use it for swimming.
	- The solicitor decided to **==circumscribe==** the pond and divide it into two parts: one for fishing and one for swimming. However, as summer came along, the water in the pond began to **==evaporate==**.
	- The villagers were worried that they would lose their pond. But the solicitor came up with a solution: they would dig a well to refill the pond. And so they did and everyone was happy.
	- As time passed, the solicitor grew old and was struck with **==infirmity==**. He could no longer walk around the village and help solve problems as he used to. The villagers missed his wisdom and guidance.
