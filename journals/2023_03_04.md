	- Once upon a time, there was an **==internist==** who worked with great **==intensity==**. One day, he received news that his best friend had passed away. He was filled with **==grief==** and felt **==deprived==** of happiness. As he mourned his loss, he became **==disillusioned==** with life and its many hardships. However, as time passed, he realized that **==whereas==** life can bring sorrow it can also bring great joy and good **==fortune==**. He learned to ==cherish== the memories of his friend and found peace.
